## BlueQubit Challenge by PeaQPerf0rmance

This repository contains the code developed to solve the BlueQubit Challenge.  
The `.qasm` files are located in the `qasm` folder, and the main challenge-solving code can be found in `main.py` while the libraries are in the `src` folder.

## Getting Started

To test the code, please install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```
Next, fill in the .env file with the required token. This file is automatically loaded when running main.py.
Once that is done, execute the following command:

```
python main.py
```
